# ****Kaggle-Flower-Recognition-CNN****

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict flowers of 5 types using the flower recognition dataset on Kaggle.

There are 5 types of flowers that are predicted and trained on:

1.Daisy

2.Dandelion

3.Rose

4.Sunflower

5.Tulip

There are 4242 images in the original dataset.

I use a simple CNN to do training and predictions. 

# Approach:

1 ) Importing Various Modules

2 ) Preparing the Data

3 ) Modelling

4 ) Evaluating the Model Performance

5 ) Visualizing Predictons on the Validation Set
